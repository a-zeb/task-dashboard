# Reflection

## How you implemented React and TypeScript features

- I used useState for state management, props to pass data and typing to ensure data persistance.

## The challenges you encountered and how you overcame them

- I had issues deciding which approach to take for state management but I decided to use a state array so that I could get some practice with it.

## Your approach to component composition and state management

- I decided to manage state by iterating through a state array variable and accessing it via event names. I composed all components inside of the dashboard
